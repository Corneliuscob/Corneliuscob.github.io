During the roman empire, a small town was formed named Barcoloni. This town flourished as a trade route and grew larger and larger. Now, Barcelona boasts one of the most population dense cities in the world with ancient structures interwoven in with the new. You will find new stores built between 2 stone walls or a posh coffee shop in the side of an ancient rampart. It is truly a sight to see. 

Tourism is booming with the streets filling up with people from around the world. The museums littered across the city provide wonderful insight to the city's arts, history and even chocolate! And you can't forget about the churches; they are a true testament to Spanish architecture.

The culture is very welcoming, even walking home at 4 in the morning, you feel safe as you amble down the streets. People actually ask __you__ to go in the night club, not the other way around. Living costs are a lot lower in spain so drinking at bars are actually a fun possibility. The night life too is its own beast as clubs open at 11 and run until 4 or 5 in the morning.

Colplay was awesome! They did an amazing job of bringing visuals together with their music and interacting with the crowd. We were given LED bands that lit-up to the songs during the concert making you feel like you were immersed into the music. Chris Martin is a lovely person whose charisma really makes a difference watching the show live versus on CD.

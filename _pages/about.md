I am a Chemical and Biological Engineer with focus on __design__ and __instrumentation__. Furthermore, I am developing strong foundations in __frontend__ and __backend__ programming


I am a Chemical and Biological Engineer with focus on __design__ and __instrumentation__ using *Solidworks* and *Inventor*. Furthermore, I am developing strong foundations in __frontend__ and __backend__ programming such as *HTML*, *CSS*, *ruby*, and *python*.

On the side, I enjoy __tinkering__ with electronics and microcontrollers to __automate__ random things in the house as well as burning my fingers

In my spare time I practice martial arts and play video games. ~cheers!

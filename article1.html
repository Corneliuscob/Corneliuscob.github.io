      <h2>Solder fan system</h2>
      Recently, I've been playing aroudn with old computer power supplies and naturally, that led me to other components of the computer, namely, the cooling fan. These fans are driven by a brushless DC motor system. This is to achieve a reduced sound and higher efficiency compared to a brushed DC motor system.



       Computer fans can range from very simple to kind of simple with 2, 3, and 4 wires coming out  of it. The 2 wire configuration is the simplest and this is just power and ground. A third wire is introduced to be able to monitor the speed of the fan. This is done most commonly by using a hall sensor to measure the rotations of the rotors around the commutator. The 4th wire adds PWM control to the fan so that consumers can control the speed of the fan.

      When you're prototype is done, or you want to make your cicuit more permanent, or you don't want to spend money making a PCB, a perf board is the solution. There are many different types of perfboards. Some have

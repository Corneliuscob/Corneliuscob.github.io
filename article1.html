      <h2>Solder fan system</h2>
      <p style="margin-right: 15%; margin-left: 15%">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I've been playing around with old computer power supplies and naturally, that led me to other components of the computer, namely, the cooling fan. These fans are driven by a brushless DC motor system. This is to achieve a reduced sound and higher efficiency compared to a brushed DC motor system.



       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer fans can range from very simple to kind of simple with 2, 3, and 4 wires coming out  of it. The 2 wire configuration is the simplest and this is just power and ground. A third wire is introduced to be able to monitor the speed of the fan. This is done most commonly by using a hall sensor to measure the rotations of the rotors around the commutator. The 4th wire adds PWM control to the fan so that consumers can control the speed of the fan.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My computer fans significantly bring down the temperature of my raspberry pi. Under normal operating temperatures, the pi typically reaches ~68 C, and ~80 C when performing calculations or running a video. With the fan, the temperature is quickly lowered to ~37 C. I will add a fan to this system soon but right now, my use of my fans are for soldering.   <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> Soldering fumes are bad for you!</b> In no sense are they good. Get rid of them! When I solder in my room, I open my windows and that still isn't enough. I use my PC fans to create a solder fume extractor that I would otherwise, have to buy commercially <a href="http://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/apex-tool-group/WSA350/WSA350-ND/1130559"> like this </a>. I created a tiny switch board for my fans and I had them running! This was  a good start but it didnt fully solve the problem as the fumes were merely being diluted. In the chemical buildings the solution is dilution. That's not good enough for me in my room, so I bought some carbon filters and attached them onto my fans. This lowers the volume of air displaced by the fan but the filter works much better.<br>



      When you're prototype is done, or you want to make your cicuit more permanent, or you don't want to spend money making a PCB, a perf board is the solution. There are many different types of perfboards. Some have
